# Accessibility

We will try to make our websites more accessible to the people with disabilites. It gives us a compititive advantage in the web development field. This isn't just for now. Making our site accessible not only boosts user satisfaction but also leaves a great impression on clients. Plus, it sets the stage for future projects where accessibility isn't just a nice-to-have but a must-have feature.

This isn't about just ticking the boxes. People with disablity should be able to use all of our websites features like editing making a comment, being able to post thier own media etc with little to no inconvenience.
